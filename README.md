# Movies-Entertainment-Website-Using-HTML-and-CSS-
My first html css project 
Welcome to the Movie Entertainment Website project.
This is a static website built using HTML and CSS. 
The website includes only home page.
The website includes images from Hotstar and Netflix to enhance the visual appeal. However, due to the lack of JavaScript, some features that might be expected on similar platforms, such as video playback or dynamic content loading, are not functional.
